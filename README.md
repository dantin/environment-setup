## Background

As a backend developer, I spend most of time working on Linux, as a result, I usually need to maintain simillar
software on those Linux boxes.

Inspired by the **DRY** priciple, I create this project as an assistant to help me setting those tools.

> DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.

## Install

__Warning:__ If you want to give these Ansible Playbooks a try, you should first fork this repository, review
the code, and remove things you don't want or need. Don't blindly use my Ansible Playbooks unless you know what
that entails. Use at your own risk!
